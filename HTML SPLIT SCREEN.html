   <center><h1>VIRAT KOHLI'S INDIA UNDER-19</h1><center>
    <P>In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s[28] and 49 in the three-match Test series.[29] India Under-19 went on to win both the series. In September, the India Under-19 team toured Pakistan. Kohli averaged 58 in the Test series[30] and 41.66 in the ODI series against Pakistan Under-19s.[31]

      In April 2007, he made his Twenty20 debut[32] and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the Inter-State T20 Championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[33] In July–August 2007, the India Under-19 team toured Sri Lanka. In the triangular series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, Kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs at an average of 29 from 5 matches.[34][35] In the two-match Test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a century and a fifty.[36]
      
      In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia. Batting at number 3, he scored 235 runs in 6 matches at an average of 47 and finished as the tournament's third-highest run-getter and one of the three batsmen to score a hundred in the tournament.[37][38] He has helped India in a three-wicket semi-final win over New Zealand Under-19s by taking 2 wickets and scoring 43 runs in the run-chase and was awarded the man of the match.[39][40]
      
      In June 2008, Kohli and his Under-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. The scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[38] He was also picked in the India Emerging Players squad for the four-team Emerging Players Tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.[41]</P>
    <h1>VIRAT KOHLI'S INTERNATIONAL CARRER </h1>
    <P>In August 2008, Kohli was included in the Indian ODI squad for tour of Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had played only eight List A matches.[42] So, his selection was called a "surprise call-up".[43] During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag were injured, Kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series.[44] He made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first ODI of the tour and was dismissed for 12.[45] He made his first ODI half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match.[45]

      After the postponement of the Champions Trophy to 2009, Kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured Shikhar Dhawan in the India A squad for the unofficial Tests against Australia A in September 2008.[46]
      
      Kohli, after recovering from a minor shoulder injury, returned to the national team replacing the injured Gautam Gambhir in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka.[47] He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh.[48] He found a place in the home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27[49] and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained fitness for the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely.[50][51] Kohli returned to the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 114 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir.[45][52] India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1.[45]
      
      Tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh in January 2010,[53] which enabled Kohli to play in each of India's five matches.[54] During this series He became only the third Indian batsman to score two ODI centuries before their 22nd birthday.[55] Kohli was much praised for his performances during the series[56][57][58] as the leading run scorer of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66.[59]</P>
    <h1>VIRAT KOHLI SETTING RECORDS</h1>
    <P>Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches.[140] In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first century as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.[141][142] Many senior players, including Dhoni, were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time.[143] In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.[144] He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 68*.[45] India completed a 5–0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series.[145]

      Kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match ODI series against Australia. After top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at Pune,[146] he struck the fastest century by an Indian in ODIs in the second match at Jaipur. Reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with Rohit Sharma that came in 17.2 overs,[147] Kohli's innings of 100* helped India chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. This chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in ODI cricket at the time, while Kohli's knock became the fastest century against Australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase.[148] He followed that innings with 68 in the next match at Mohali in another Indian defeat,[149] before the next two matches were washed out by rain.[150] In the sixth ODI at Nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help India successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2–2 and won the man of the match.[151] He reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest ODI century by an Indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in ODI cricket.[152] India clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck.[153] At the conclusion of the series, Kohli moved to the top position in the ICC ODI batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.[5]
      
      Kohli batted twice in the two-match Test series against the West Indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by Shane Shillingford in both innings.[154][155] This was also the last Test series for Tendulkar and Kohli was expected to take Tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series.[156] In the first game of the three-match ODI series that followed at Kochi, Kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match.[157] During the match, he also equalled Viv Richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in ODI cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings. He missed out on his third century at Visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off Ravi Rampaul.[158][159] India lost the match by two wickets,[159] but took the series 2–1 after winning the last match at Kanpur.[160] With 204 runs at 68.00, Kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series.[161][160]</P>
    <h1>VIRAT KOHLI OVERSEAS SEASON</h1>
    <P>India toured South Africa in December 2013 for three ODIs and two Tests. Kohli averaged 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck.[162] In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa[163] and batting at 4 for the first time,[81] Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998.[164] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[165] India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.[81]

      During New Zealand tour, he averaged 58.21 in the five-match ODI series[166] in which his all efforts went in vain as India were defeated 4–0. He made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match Test series that followed[167] including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second Test at Wellington that helped India save the match.[168]
      
      India then traveled to Bangladesh for the Asia Cup and World Twenty20. Dhoni was ruled out of the Asia Cup after suffering a side strain during the New Zealand tour, which led to Kohli being named the captain for the tournament.[169] Kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in India's opening match against Bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with Ajinkya Rahane, which helped India successfully chase 280.[170] It was his 19th ODI century and his fifth in Bangladesh, making him the batsman with most ODI centuries in Bangladesh.[171] India were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, in which Kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively.[45]Dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and Kohli was named vice-captain. In India's opening match of the tournament against Pakistan, Kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide India to a seven-wicket win. He scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against West Indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against Bangladesh, both in successful run-chases.[63] In the semi-final, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help India achieve the target of 173.[172] He won the man of the match for this knock. India posted 130/4 in the final against Sri Lanka, in which Kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets.[173] Kohli made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single World Twenty20 tournament,[174] for which he won the Man of the Tournament award.[173]
      
      India conceded a 3–1 defeat in the five-match Test series against England. Kohli fared poorly in the series averaging just 13.40 in 10 innings scoring 134 runs overall with a top score of 39.[175] It was a nightmare tour for him as he was dismissed for single-digit scores on six occasions in the series and was particularly susceptible to the swinging ball on off stump line, being dismissed several times edging the ball to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders. Man of the series James Anderson got Kohli's wicket four times,[176] while Kohli's batting technique was questioned by analysts and former cricketers.[177][178] India won the ODI series that followed 3–1, but Kohli's struggles with the bat continued with an average of 18 in four innings.[179] In the one-off T20I, he scored 41-ball 66, his first fifty-plus score of the tour. India lost the match by three runs, but Kohli reached the number one spot for T20I batsmen in the ICC rankings.[180]
      
      Kohli had a successful time during India's home ODI series win over the West Indies in October 2014. His 62 in the second ODI at Delhi was his first fifty across Tests and ODIs in 16 innings since February,[181] and he stated that he got his "confidence back" with the innings.[182] He struck his 20th ODI hundred–127 runs in 114 balls–in the fourth match at Dharamsala. India registered a 59-run victory and Kohli was awarded man of the match.[183] Dhoni was rested for the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka in November, enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series. Kohli batted at 4 throughout the series and made scores of 22, 49, 53 and 66 in the first four ODIs, with India leading the series 4–0. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, he made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and a whitewash of Sri Lanka.[184] Kohli was awarded player of the series, and it was the second whitewash under his captaincy.[185] During the series he became the fastest batter in the world to go past the 6000-run mark in ODIs.[186] With 1054 ODI runs at 58.55 in 2014, he became the second player in the world after Sourav Ganguly to make more than 1,000 runs in ODIs for four consecutive calendar years.[187]</P>
    <h1>VIRAT KOHLI'S TEST CAPTAINCY</h1>
    <P>For the first Test of the Australian tour in December 2014, Dhoni was not part of the Indian team at Adelaide due to an injury, and Kohli took the reins as Test captain for the first time.[188] Kohli scored 115 in India's first innings, becoming the fourth Indian to score a hundred on Test captaincy debut.[189] In their second innings, India were set a target of 364 to be scored on the fifth day. Kohli put on 185 runs for the third wicket with Murali Vijay before Vijay's dismissal, which triggered a batting collapse. From 242/2, India was bowled out for 315 with Kohli's 141 off 175 balls being the top score.[190]

      Dhoni returned to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India.[81] In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, he made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years.[191] Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match.[81] Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[192][193] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain.[194] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a draw.[195] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.[194]
      
      In January 2015, India failed to win a single match in the tri-nation ODI series against the hosts Australia and England. Kohli was unable to replicate his Test success in ODIs, failing to make a two-digit score in any of the four games.[45] Kohli's ODI form did not improve in the lead-up to the World Cup, with scores of 18 and 5 in the warm-up matches against Australia and Afghanistan respectively.
      
      In the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls. For his knock, he was awarded the man of the match award.[196] Kohli also became first Indian batsman to score a century against Pakistan in a World Cup match.[197] He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa. India went on to register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively.[45] India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record.[198] In India's 109-run victory in the quarter-final over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3, edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India was eliminated in the semi-final by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for 1 off 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson.[45]
      
      Kohli had a slump in form when India toured Bangladesh in June 2015. He contributed only 14 in the one-off Test which ended in a draw and averaged 16.33 in the ODI series which Bangladesh won 2–1.[199] Kohli ended his streak of low scores by scoring his 11th Test hundred in the first Test of the Sri Lankan tour which India lost. India won the next two matches to seal the series 2–1, Kohli's first series win as Test captain and India's first away Test series win in four years.[200]
      
      During South Africa's tour of India, Kohli became the fastest batsman in the world to make 1,000 runs in T20I cricket, reaching the milestone in his 27th innings.[201] In the ODI series, he made a century in the fourth ODI at Chennai that helped India draw level in the series.[202] India lost the series after a defeat in the final ODI and Kohli finished the series with an average of 49.[203] India came back to beat the top-ranked South African team 3–0 in the four-match Test series under Kohli's captaincy, and climbed to number two position on the ICC Test rankings.[204] Virat scored a total of 200 runs in the series at 33.33.[81]</P>
    <h1>VIRAT KOHLI IN INDIAN PREMIER LEAGUE</h1>
    <P>Following the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was bought by the franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract.[321][322][323][324] He was the captain of Royal challengers Bangalore for 8 seasons but could not win a trophy.[325]

      Kohli had a poor 2008 season, with a total of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09.[326] He did slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final.[327] In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81.[328]
      
      Kohli was the second-highest run-getter of the season, only behind teammate Chris Gayle, and his team finished as runners-up.

He finished fifth on the season's leading run-getters list with 505 runs at an average of 45.90 and a strike rate of more than 130.[334]
      
      At the 2016 IPL, the Royal Challengers finished runners-up and Kohli broke the record for most runs in an IPL season (of 733 runs) by scoring 973 runs in 16 matches at an average of 81.08, winning the Orange Cap as well as Most-valuable Player Award of Vivo IPL 2016.[335][336] He scored four centuries in the tournament, having never scored one in the Twenty20 format before the start of the season, and also became the first player to reach the 4000-run milestone in the IPL.[337] At the launch event of his biography, Driven: The Virat Kohli Story in New Delhi, in October 2016, Kohli announced that RCB would be the IPL franchise that he would permanently play for.[338]
      
      Kohli missed the start of the 2017 season due to a shoulder injury.[339] Moreover, RCB finished the tournament at the bottom of the table, with Kohli scoring the most runs for his team, with 308 from 10 matches.[340] On the occasion of the 10 year anniversary of IPL, he was also named in the all-time Cricinfo IPL XI.[341]
      
      In the 2018 season, Kohli was retained by RCB for a price of ₹170 million (US$2.1 million), the highest for any player that year.[342] Kohli scored 530 runs in the season and became the first batsman to score more than 500 runs in 5 different seasons.[343] Moreover, RCB failed to qualify for Playoffs and finished sixth on the points table.[344]
      
      On 28 March 2019, Kohli became the second player to reach 5000 IPL runs after Suresh Raina.[345] In the same season, Kohli surpassed Raina to become leading runs scorer in IPL when he scored 84 runs in a match against KKR.[346]

    <p>In September 2021, Kohli announced that he would step down as India's T20I captain following the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup .[312][313]

      In December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. BCCI President Sourav Ganguly later explained the decision to drop Kohli as ODI captain by saying that the selectors did not feel right to have two white ball captains.[314] Later Ganguly said that BCCI had told Virat to not step down as T20I captain.[315][316] Virat Kohli, during a press conference, contradicted the BCCI President and said that his decision of stepping down as captain was "received well" and termed as "progressive" by the BCCI officials.[317] He also claimed that chief selector Chetan Sharma informed him 90-minutes before the announcement of the Test squad for India's tour of South Africa, about the removal from ODI captaincy.[317] More than a week later, during the announcement of squad for ODI series versus South Africa, Chetan Sharma contradicted Kohli by saying that officials had asked Virat to reconsider his decision of stepping down as T20I captain.[318]
